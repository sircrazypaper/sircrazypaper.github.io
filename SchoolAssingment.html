<p class="travel">If you want to get around the city, the most popular way is taking the cable cars. Taking these cable cars are a fun way to get around the city. The cable cars are a national landmark in San Francisco and they were invented nearly 150 years ago. A single ride costs 8$ no matter how old you are. You can get tickets by paying with change, through the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/fares/munimobile">MuniMobile app</a> or by using a <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do">Clipper card</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="containerForMuni">
<p class="muni">The Muni metro is a fast way to get around the city, so it’s perfect for those who might be a bit impatient. For payment there are two options, the <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do">Clipper card</a> or the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/fares/munimobile">MuniMobile app</a>. Both options are very easy, but you can use the clipper card for multiple Bay area transit systems. If you are 18 or under you can get tickets for free on a regular Muni.</p>

  <p class="bike">If you want a more fun way to get around, bikes and scooters are definitely the right option for you, the bikes are located all around the city. You can get a single ride that lasts 30 minutes for 3.49$ or a day pass for 10$ a day. A day pass is 24 hours of unlimited 30 minute rides on classic bikes. You can also get some that last a month or more, but that won't be necessary if you are just going on a vacation.
You can download the app <a href="https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels">here</a>!</p>

It is a car that can drive without needing a human to steer it, you can book a ride anytime via an app on your phone. It may seem a little scary at first but it is safer than a human driving, the car has had over 40 million miles of real life driving experience and is packed with the latest technology to ensure that your ride will be safe. Waymos cars are definitely an amazing and exciting experience for anyone who wants a ride around town.
