<h2>Gear needed:</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext">Every competitor must have a puzzle that is WCA legal for the event that they are competing in unless they are told differntly on the competition info page.</div>
<div class="ruletext">  Every competitor must have an opaque box with an open side to cover the cube during scramble-checking and before inspection. Example: hard box cube packaging.</div>
<div class="ruletext">  Every competitor must use a speedstacks gen4, gen5, GAN, or QiYi Timer to time their results.</div>
<div class="ruletext">  The judge must have a device that can act as a stopwatch for timing inspection.</div>
<div class="ruletext">  All competitors must have good lighting so that the judge can see the difference between the colors for scramble-checking.</div>

<div class="ruletext">  Every competitor must have google meets with an activated camera facing the competitor and a working microphone.</div>

<div class="ruletext">  The competitor is allowed to have a monitor showing the puzzle from an angle they can not see, but it may not be used as an advantage.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> You must have read the WCA regulations <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">Link</a> And those regulations will count unless you are told differently by a delegate or in these rules.</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Format:</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext"> There will be three main formats: A "normal" WCA competition style format, seeding rounds and a head to head format.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> In a "normal" WCA competetion format a competitor will be solving alone with an assigned judge, both following the rules for the correct procedure.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> A "seeding round" is held before a head to head tournament and will have the same procedure as the "normal" WCA competetion format. </div>

<div class="ruletext"> The seeding round will eliminate the number of competitors that must be eliminated and seed the remaining competitors according to their average in that round.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The competiors that are not eliminated will proceed to the head to head rounds. </div>

<div class="ruletext"> In the head to head format the competitor with the best seed will choose which competitor does the first solve.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> In the head to head format each competitor will take turns solving.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> In the head to head format the person with the best average proceeds to the next head to head round.</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext"> The judge will tell the competitors when a new scramble is available.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the puzzle has been scrambled, the competitor must place their cube inside the cube cover with the open face pointing towards their camera.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> If the cube is scrambled correctly the judge will say: "correct" if not the judge will say "mis-scramble".</div>

<div class="ruletext"> If the cube is scrambled incorrectly the competitor must apply at least 10 random turns to the cube, solve it and apply the scramble again.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the scramble has been confirmed to be correct the competitor must fully cover the cube.</div>

<div class="ruletext">When the competitor is  ready they must say: "ready" and then lift the cover. </div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the competitor has lifted the cover the judge must start timing the inspection time and call out the normal WCA inspection calls.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The competitor must show the judge the time for the finished solve on the google meet camera.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The WCA regulations count for penalties.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> If the Judge cannot clearly see the entire cube after the solve is completed, the competitor must take a picture and show the judge without touching the cube.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The competitor must not reset the timer or touch the cube until the judge has correctly recorded the result.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> Only the competitor solving and the judge are allowed to have their microphone turned on, everyone else must be muted!</div>

<div class="ruletext"> In the head to head format all of the rules provided above will still count but with the judge has to judge both competitors (the two competitors must still take turns to do their solves).</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Judging</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext"> The judge must check that the cube is correctly scrambled. They will be provided with an image of the scramble. The judge only needs to check one of the cubes sides.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The judge or anyone else may not tell anybody about the scramble until the competition is over.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the result has been determined the judge must write it down on a piece of paper.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the average has been finished the judge must show the paper to the delegate so that the times can be entered.</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Personal judging</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext"> A competitor may choose to not use the judge assigned for inspection time, in that case the originally assigned judge must be muted (unless the competitor says so).</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The competitor must use a different inspection timer like a phone, computer or a person E.G. a friend, that calls out WCA inspection calls.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The originally assigned judge must check if the cube is correctly scrambled, if it is correct the judge must give a "thumbs up" if not the judge must give a "thumbs down" the competitor must do as stated in the "procedure" section.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The originally assigned judge must still look at the cube and timer to verify the result, write the result down on a piece of paper.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> The originally assigned judge must also time the inspection without calling the WCA inspection calls.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> If the competitor has broken the WCA inspection time rules the originally assinged judge must wait until the solve is finished, tell the competitor that they overinspected and then change the result to fit the correct penalty.</div>

<div class="ruletext"> When the average has been finished the judge must show the paper to the delegate so that the times can be entered.</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Timer malfunctions</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext"> If a malfunction occurs during the timing or verification of the solve/result the competitor(s) will get an extra attempt.</div>

<div class="ruletext">If a timer unintentionally turns off or resets during a solve the competitor(s) will be given an extra attempt.</div>

<div class="ruletext">If the timer displays a number below 0.06 the competitor(s) will be given an extra attmpt.</div>

<div class="ruletext">In any case not covered in these rules the judge must decide if it will be an extra attempt or a DNF.</div>

<p>spacer</p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>spacer</p>

<div class="ruletext">If the judge suspects a competitor for cheating the result will be enterd as a DNF.</div>

<div class="ruletext">If a competitor has cheated multiple times the organizer can ban the competitor.</div>
